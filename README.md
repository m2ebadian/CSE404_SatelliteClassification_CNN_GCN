# **Satellite Image Classification with CNN and GCN**

This project explores satellite image classification using both a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** on the **EuroSAT** dataset. The goal was to compare how traditional CNNs and graph-based models perform on land-cover classification tasks.

The work was done as part of **CSE404: Machine Learning** at Michigan State University, with a focus on building and experimenting with real models rather than just following templates.

## **Project Overview**

- **Dataset:** [EuroSAT](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat), consisting of 27,000 RGB satellite images across 10 land-cover classes (forests, crops, urban, water bodies, etc.).
- **Baseline Model:** ResNet-18 (pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for EuroSAT).
- **Graph Model:** GCN built on top of ResNet-18 feature embeddings, with a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) graph constructed using cosine similarity.
- **Key Goal:** Compare accuracy and generalization between CNN and GCN, and analyze where graph-based methods help or fail in satellite image classification.

## **Results**

| Model        | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **ResNet-18 (CNN)** | **96.7%** | 96.7% | 96.7% | 96.7% |
| **GCN (ResNet features + kNN graph)** | **91.1%** | 91.3% | 91.1% | 91.2% |

- **CNN Strengths:** Excellent generalization and high accuracy across most classes.
- **GCN Insights:** Added relational information between images, but performance suffered due to weak inter-image relationships in EuroSAT and limitations of batch-wise kNN graphs.
